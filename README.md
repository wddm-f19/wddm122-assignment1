# Assignment 1: Custom SPA Framework

Using the SPA framework as a starting point, create a three `Page` application for the Humber Media Pros website. Each of the pages will represent the HTML template for one of: 

- **Home**: A generic homepage (may just be static)
- **Program**: Represents one of the three programs offered
- **Student**: Represents the content for one student 

## Getting started today
1. In a group of 3 or 4, plan the content for each of the three pages above
1. Create a Github Organization for your team
1. Create a repo named after your organization in this format: `[orgname].github.io` (where `[orgname]` is replaced by your organization name)
1. Give access to the entire Organization (or just the Repo) to your team members
1. Create a README file with the following in it and commit to `master`
	```
	# Humber Media Pros

	## Group
	```
1. Each member should write a ticket reminding themselves to "Add my name to the README.md"
   1. Assign it to yourself
   1. Add at least one "label" to the issue (use the most appropriate one)
1. Each member should now clone the repo, create a unique branch, and in that branch, add their name under the `# Group` heading, with a link to their Github homepage
1. When you commit your work, use the commit message to `close #` the ticket
1. Each member should create a pull request
1. As a group, sit together and select one person to merge all of the requests into `master`
1. After managing all merge conflicts, commit all the changes to `master` and push the branch to remote
1. Prune all of the name branches to demonstrate that functionality
1. On Slack, create a group message that includes all members of your group and the instructor, then paste the link to your Github Organization into it

## Project requirements
- Delegate roles to all group members
- Decide on any dependencies your team may wish to incorporate (ie, Sass, etc)
- Develop a plan for the layout of each page
- Decide on the general design system (colours, fonts, etc)
- Build a router that will navigate to all pages as an SPA
- All work must be done in branches
- All communication must go through "Issues", including (but not limited to):
  - Code bugs
  - Design decisions
  - Assigned tasks
  - Content changes
- Issues must be managed (open/comment/close)
